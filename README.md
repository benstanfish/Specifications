### Recommendation
It's recommended to use the scrape_batch.py script as it will also work on a single file within the selected directory. Reports are created as .csv files, in the same folder as the .sec(s) that are parsed. If you run the batch version, the file name is time-stamped to prevent overwriting. Both scripts only work on .sec files, which are actually XML files skinned as SEC for SpecsIntact.
